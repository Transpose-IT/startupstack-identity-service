# startupstack identity

This service provides support for creating users and tenants in startupstack. Currently it implements its backend with Keycloak. The admin client needs to be updated to resteasy 4, which is scheduled to be included with 9.0.1 - this has not yet been released so we will have to wait for this before we can continue working on this.
